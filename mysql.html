<B> Reset mysql root password <B><br>
<pre>
    sudo vim /etc/mysql/my.cnf

    Add the following lines at the end:

    [mysqld]

    skip-grant-tables

    sudo service mysql restart

    mysql -u root

    use mysql

    select * from mysql.user where user = 'root'; - Look at the top to determine whether the password column is called password or authentication_string

    UPDATE mysql.user set *password_field from above* = PASSWORD('your_new_password') where user = 'root' and host = 'localhost'; - Use the proper password column from above

    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

    exit

    sudo vim /etc/mysql/my.cnf

    Remove the lines added in step 2 if you want to keep your security standards.

    sudo service mysql restart
